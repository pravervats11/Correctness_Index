# Correctness_Index
Checking Correctness of an algorithm used. This has been done by using SVC classification algorithm. This will be very useful for getting Correctness Index of an algorithm like getting text out of image (by Deep Learning) , OCR etc.

#### Dependencies required for this :-  
* Python 3.5.3
* sklearn / scikit-learn
* datetime
* pandas

Correctness Index Algorithm has 99.79 % accuracy which is believed to be more than 95 % even with more features.
